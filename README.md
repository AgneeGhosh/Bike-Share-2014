# Bay Area Bike Share 2014 Data Analysis: Work Methodology

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike share data from the Bay Area in 2014. The aim was to explore bike usage patterns, including peak hours, most popular routes, and trip duration by user type using R.

## Tools Used

R: Primary language for data analysis.
dplyr: For data manipulation.
ggplot2: For data visualization.
lubridate: For date and time manipulation.

## Step-by-Step Methodology

### 1. Data Import and Inspection

The first step was to load the dataset into R and inspect its structure. This was done using the read.csv() function and initial exploration with head() and summary() functions.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning involved checking for missing values, converting the trip start and end times to a date-time format using lubridate, and creating new columns for easier analysis, such as extracting the hour of the day.

### 3. Separate Data Analyses

#### 3.1 Peak Hours Analysis
To determine the busiest times for bike trips, the data was grouped by the hour of the day, and the number of trips during each hour was counted.

#### 3.2 Most Popular Routes
The most frequent start and end station combinations were identified to highlight popular routes. This was done by grouping the data by start and end station pairs and counting the occurrences.

#### 3.3 Trip Duration by User Type
The dataset includes different user types (e.g., Subscriber, Customer). To analyze how trip duration varies between these groups, the data was grouped by user type, and the average trip duration was calculated.

### 4. Visualizations
Each analysis was followed by a corresponding visualization using ggplot2 to represent the findings clearly. For example, bar charts were used to show the distribution of trip durations by user type, and line graphs were employed for time-based analysis.

### 5. Results & Findings
Peak Hours: The busiest times for bike share usage were during commuting hours (morning and evening).
Popular Routes: A few routes, particularly between certain high-traffic stations, were used significantly more than others.
User Type Differences: Subscribers generally had shorter trip durations than customers.

Through separate analyses of peak hours, popular routes, and trip duration by user type, valuable insights were gained into the bike usage patterns in the Bay Area in 2014. Each analysis was conducted with a clear approach and supplemented by appropriate visualizations to illustrate the results effectively.
